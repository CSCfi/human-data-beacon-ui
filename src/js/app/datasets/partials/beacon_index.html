    Note: The EGA archives a large number of datasets, some of which are <span class="label label-success">Publicly</span> available. If you have an account on this website, you can access to <span class="label label-warning">Registered</span> datasets. To access <span class="label label-danger">Controlled</span> datasets can be done by contacting the relevant Data Access Committee (DAC), whose details are displayed on the Dataset description page under "Who controls access to this dataset" (click on the Dataset ID to go to the Dataset page). Once you have access to a dataset, you will be able to query it at EGA Beacon.
